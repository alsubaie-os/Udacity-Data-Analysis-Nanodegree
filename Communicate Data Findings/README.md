## Introduction

In this project, I will be wrangling and analyzing a dataset which includes the total number of employees in Saudi Arabia (Saudi (male) - Saudi (female) - non Saudi (male) - non Saudi (Female)) according to the size of the enterprises (micros, small, medium, and large) and economic activity(using the National Classification of Economic Activities (ISIC4) - the second level) in each geographical region for 2022.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

> Total Number of Employees: This is the primary variable of interest, as it represents the count of employees in various enterprises across different regions and economic activities. It provides insights into the overall workforce distribution and size.

> Geographical Region: The geographical region is an important factor that can impact the distribution of employees. Analyzing how the number of employees varies across different regions can reveal patterns of economic activity and workforce distribution.

> Economic Activity (ISIC4): Economic activity categories provide information about the types of industries and sectors where employees are working. Analyzing how the distribution of employees varies across different economic activities can provide insights into the economic landscape.

> Enterprise Size: The size of enterprises (micro, small, medium, large) is a key factor that can influence the number of employees. Understanding how employees are distributed across enterprise sizes can offer insights into the role of different types of businesses in the workforce.

> Gender and Nationality: The dataset appears to include gender (male, female) and nationality (Saudi, non-Saudi) breakdowns. Analyzing the workforce distribution based on gender and nationality can provide insights into workforce diversity and composition.
