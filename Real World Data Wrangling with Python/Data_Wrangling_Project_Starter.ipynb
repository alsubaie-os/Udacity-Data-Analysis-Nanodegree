    "I will be investigating patterns and trends in real estate sales in Connecticut with a focus on understanding the relationship between property types, sales prices, and property assessments. The dataset I will be working with consists of records of real estate sales with a sales price of $2,000 or greater, occurring annually between October 1 and September 30. Each record includes information such as town, property address, sale date, property type (residential, apartment, commercial, industrial, vacant land), sales price, and property assessment. This analysis aims to uncover insights into property market dynamics and assess the accuracy of property assessments relative to sales prices within the given time frame, using data collected in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes.\n",

    "I would aim to answer research questions like how property type affects the sales price-to-assessment ratio, whether there are geographical patterns in these ratios, and how these ratios evolve over the years. Addressing these aspects would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the real estate market dynamics and the reliability of property assessments. I would also like to explore the relationship between the sales price-to-assessment ratio and the sales price-to-list price ratio. This would help to understand whether the assessment ratio is a good predictor of the sales price-to-list price ratio, which is a common metric used to assess the competitiveness of the real estate market."
