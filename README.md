# Project 1 : Investigate a Medical Appointment No Show Dataset

> In this project, I will be analyzing data associated with medical appointments in Brazil.

> - The most important one if the patient show-up or no-show to the appointment
> - What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
> - The analysis will be done using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.
> - The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).
